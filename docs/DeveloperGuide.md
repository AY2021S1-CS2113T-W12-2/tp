## Introduction

Welcome to ATHENA's Developer Guide! ATHENA (which stands for Automated Timetable Helper Encourager n' Assistant), is a desktop daily life planner that aims to help students automate the process of organising their schedule. It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based application that helps users figure out the best timetable after the user has input their pre-allocated time slots for work and relaxation.

This document describes the software architecture and design of ATHENA that should hopefully help you - a developer, designer, or software tester - understand  the inner workings of ATHENA. 


## Setting up and getting started

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have `JDK 11` installed on your computer.
2. Install IntelliJ IDEA (referred to as IntelliJ in the rest of this document).

### Setting up the project on your computer
1. Fork [this](https://https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp) repository, and clone the fork onto your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (If you do not see the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle  
   1. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
   2. Click `Newâ€¦` and select the directory where you have installed `JDK 11`.
   3. Click `OK`.
4. By default, IntelliJ has the Gradle plugin installed. If you have disabled it, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable it.
5. Click `Import Project`(or `Open or Import` in newer versions of IntelliJ).
6. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`. If prompted, choose to `Open as Project` (not `Open as File`).
7. Click `OK` to accept the default settings, if prompted. 
8. Wait for the importing process to finish, and you are good to go!
9. Verify the setup:
    1. Run `Athena` and try a few commands such as `list` or `help`.
    2. Run the JUnit tests to ensure they all pass.

## **Design & implementation**

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](structures/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of ATHENA. A quick overview of each component is shown below.

**`Main`** has one class called [`Athena`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Athena.java). It is responsible for:
* At application launch: Initializes the components and connects them up with each other.
* At application shut down: Shuts down the components.

The rest of the application consists of these components:

* [**`Ui`**](#athenaUi-component): The user interface of ATHENA.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Parses user input and executes commands.
* [**`TaskList`**](#tasklist-component): The list that stores the user's tasks.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how these components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues a command.

*work in progress*

The sections below give more details for each component.

### UI component

![UiStructure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alstontham/tp/DG-UG/docs/structures/UiStructure.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Ui.java)

1. `Ui` consists of `AthenaUi` and `ColorText`
2. `AthenaUi` implements `Ui` interface and outputs messages that the user sees
3. `ColorText` applies relevant colors to certain output messages
4. `AthenaUi` also prints out error messages tied to `Command Exception` that get thrown by `Athena`
5. `LogicManager` requires `AthenaUi` to execute user commands

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](structures/LogicStructure.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `TaskList` (e.g. adding a task).
4. The result of the command execution will also call the `Ui` to print the respective messages for each command.


### TaskList component

![TaskListStructure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wish2023/tp/DG-tasklist/docs/structures/TaskListStructure.png)

[`TaskList.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/TaskList.java)

1. The `TaskList` stores task data in `Task` type objects.
2. The `TaskList` is updated in `Athena`.
3. A new `Task` object is created everytime the user uses the command `add`.

### Storage component

[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Storage.java)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add task feature
The adding of task mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager`.

The retrieving of task details is done by `Parser`. It splits the user input based on the command type and the various parameters' description.
The user can input the parameters in any order.
The `AddCommand` class will then be executed and the task will be added to the `TaskList`.

`Parser`, `AddCommand`, `TaskList` implements the following operations:

* `Parser#parse` - Parse user input to retrieve the command type and task details.
* `Parser#parseAddCommand` - Parse user input to retrieve the respective parameters' details and creates an `AddCommand` object.
* `AddCommand#execute` - Add task into `TaskList` and calls `Ui` to print message output.
* `Storage#saveTaskListData` - Writes the current task list into the save file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the task adding mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user adds a task to the application, by inputting `add n/Assignment1 t/1100 D/16-09-2020 d/2 r/Today i/high a/Refer to lecture notes`. 

**Step 2.** The input will be read in by the `Athena` class. The input will be passed into `LogicManager` where `Parser#parse` will parse the user input to get the command type and details then call`Parse#parseAddCommand`to create a `AddCommand` object. The `AddCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 3.** The `LogicManager` calls `AddCommand#execute`. The `TaskList` now contains 1 task (Assignment1). The message to show if the task is added successfully is subsequently outputted by the `AthenaUi` class to the user.

**Step 4.** After the command is executed, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveTaskListData` to automatically save the tasks in the `TaskList` into the save file.

**Step 5.** Upon completion of execution, `LogicManager` returns a boolean value `false` to `Athena` to allow the continuous run of the program. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how Step 3 of the task adding operation works:

![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](https://ay2021s1-cs2113t-w12-2.github.io/tp/sequenceDiagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete task feature
The deleting task mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager`.

The retrieving of input details is done by `Parser`. It splits the user input based on the command type and the index of task.
The `DeleteCommand` class will then be executed and the task will be removed from the `TaskList`.

`Parser`, `DeleteCommand`, `TaskList` implements the following operations:

* `Parser#parse` - Parse user input to retrieve the command type and index of task.
* `Parser#parseDeleteCommand` - Parse user input to retrieve the index of task to be deleted and creates an `DeleteCommand` object.
* `DeleteCommand#execute` - Remove task into `TaskList` and calls `Ui` to print message output.
* `Storage#saveTaskListData` - Updates the current task list into the save file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the deleting task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user deletes a task from the application, by inputting `delete 1`. 

**Step 2.** The input will be read in by the `Athena` class. The input will be passed into `LogicManager` where `Parser#parse` will parse the user input to get the command type and details then call`Parse#parseDeleteCommand`to create a `DeleteCommand` object.The `DeleteCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 3.** The `LogicManager` calls `DeleteCommand#execute`. The `TaskList` now removed task with index 1. The message to show if the task is deleted successfully is subsequently outputted by the `AthenaUi` class to the user.

**Step 4.** After the command is executed, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveTaskListData` to automatically save the tasks in the `TaskList` into the save file.

**Step 4.** Upon completion of execution, `LogicManager` returns a boolean value `false` to `Athena` to allow the continuous run of the program. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how Step 3 of the task deleting operation works:

*work in progress*

### Mark task as done feature
The marking task as done mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager`.

The retrieving of input details is done by `Parser`. It splits the user input based on the command type and the index of task.
The `DoneCommand` class will then be executed and the task will be marked as done in the `TaskList`.

`Parser`, `DoneCommand`, `TaskList` implements the following operations:

* `Parser#parse` - Parse user input to retrieve the command type and index of task.
* `Parser#parseDoneCommand` - Parse user input to retrieve the index of task to be marked as done and creates an `DoneCommand` object.
* `DoneCommand#execute` - Marks task as done into `TaskList` and calls `AthenaUi` to print message output.
* `Storage#saveTaskListData` - Writes the current task list into the save file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the marking task as done mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user marks a task as done in the application, by inputting `done 1`. 

**Step 2.** The input will be read in by the `Athena` class. The input will be passed into `LogicManager` where `Parser#parse` will parse the user input to get the command type and details then call`Parse#parseDoneCommand`to create a `DoneCommand` object. The `DoneCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 3.** The `LogicManager` calls `DoneCommand#execute`. The `TaskList` now has task with index 1 marked as done. The message to show if the task is marked as done successfully is subsequently outputted by the `AthenaUi` class to the user.
 
**Step 4.** After the command is executed, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveTaskListData` to automatically save the tasks in the `TaskList` into the save file.

**Step 5.** Upon completion of execution, `LogicManager` returns a boolean value `false` to `Athena` to allow the continuous run of the program. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how Step 3 of the marking task as done operation works:

*work in progress*

### Edit task feature
The editing of task mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager`.

The retrieving of task details is done by `Parser`. It splits the user input based on the command type and the various parameters' description.
The user can input the parameters in any order.
The `EditCommand` class will then be executed and the edited task details will be added to the `TaskList`.

`Parser`, `EditCommand`, `TaskList` implements the following operations:

* `Parser#parse` - Parse user input to retrieve the command type, task index and details.
* `Parser#parseEditCommand` - Parse user input to retrieve the respective parameters' details and creates an `EditCommand` object.
* `EditCommand#execute` - Edits the specified task in `TaskList` and calls `Ui` to print message output.
* `Storage#saveTaskListData` - Writes the current task list into the save file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user edits a task to the application, by inputting `edit 1 n/Assignment2 t/1100 D/16-09-2020`. 

**Step 2.** The input will be read in by the `Athena` class. The input will be passed into `LogicManager` where `Parser#parse` will parse the user input to get the command type and details then call`Parse#parseEditCommand`to create a `EditCommand` object. The `EditCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 3.** The `LogicManager` calls `EditCommand#execute`. The `TaskList` now has task with index 1 name changed from "Assignment1" to "Assignment2". The message to show if the task is edited successfully is subsequently outputted by the `AthenaUi` class to the user.
 
**Step 4.** After the command is executed, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveTaskListData` to automatically save the edited task details in the `TaskList` into the save file.

**Step 5.** Upon completion of execution, `LogicManager` returns a boolean value `false` to `Athena` to allow the continuous run of the program. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how Step 3 of the editing task operation works:

![EditTaskSequenceDiagram](sequenceDiagrams/EditCommand%20diagram.png)

### View task feature
The viewing task mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager`.

The retrieving of input details is done by `Parser`. It splits the user input based on the command type and the index of task.
The `ViewCommand` class will then be executed and the details of that specific task from the `TaskList` will be shown.

`Parser`, `ViewCommand`, `TaskList` implements the following operations:

* `Parser#parse` - Parse user input to retrieve the command type and index of task.
* `Parser#parseViewCommand` - Parse user input to retrieve the index of task to be viewed and creates an `ViewCommand` object.
* `ViewCommand#execute` - Retrieve task details from `TaskList` and calls `Ui` to print task details output.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the viewing task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user views a task from the application, by inputting `view 1`. 

**Step 2.** The input will be read in by the `Athena` class. The input will be passed into `LogicManager` where `Parser#parse` will parse the user input to get the command type and details then call`Parse#parseViewCommand`to create a `ViewCommand` object. The `ViewCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 3.** The `LogicManager` calls `ViewCommand#execute`. The `TaskList` now retrieve details of 1 task (Assignment 1). The message to show if the task details is subsequently outputted by the `AthenaUi` class to the user.

**Step 4.** Upon completion of execution, `LogicManager` returns a boolean value `false` to `Athena` to allow the continuous run of the program. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how Step 3 of the viewing task operation works:

*work in progress*

### Time allocation to task in timetable
The time allocation mechanism is facilitated by `TimeAllocator`. It allocates time slots to `Task`s in a `TaskList` that are not assigned a fixed time slot by the user. It implements the following operations:

* Work in progress hehe

Implementation
TimeAllocator takes in  TaskList and separates it into a fixedTaskList and a flexibleTaskList

When runAllocate is executed, a ForecastFilter is created in order to separate the tasks based on their days in order to identify the day that they belong to.

An ArrayList named dayLog is used to keep track of the times that the tasks take up during the day, it stores the taskNumber that occupies each of the hourly slots.

Fixed tasks are placed into the dayLog first as they do not change. 

The start time and sleep time is referenced together with the dayLog to identify the vacant slots.

bestLog identifies the tasks from the flexibleTaskList that reduces the dead space in the logs based on changing the tasks available for getLog to insert into the logs.

getLog iterates through the TaskList provided to it and checks if there is enough space in the log for the task before slotting it in. Once it runs out of valid tasks or if the log is fully filled, it returns the log and modifies the provided TaskList to contain the leftover tasks

The process repeats until the dayLog contains no valid positions for tasks in the flexibleTaskList.

The taskNumber is then used to identify what task to modify. It changes the startTime of this task to the first index it is identified at which corresponds to the hour that it started at.

It then modifies the ForecastFilter to identify the tasks on the next day.

Once runAllocate finishes running, it changes the startTime of tasks that have been allocated without altering the isFlexible attribute of the tasks.





Given below is an example usage scenario and how the allocation mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application. The *data.csv* file located next to the application jar file contains 5 tasks. These tasks are loaded into the `TaskList`. 3 of them have a fixed time slot, while the other 2 are not assigned any time slot.

**Step 2.** The user executes `list` to get an overview of the week. The user sees the 3 tasks with a fixed time slot in the printed timetable.

**Step 3**. The user executes `allocate` to let the application allocate time slots to `Task`s without a fixed time slot.

`TimeAllocator` iterates through the `TaskList`, and checks whether a `Task` has a fixed time slot or should be allocated by the application to an empty slot. Tasks that have a fixed slot are added to a `fixedTaskList`, while the rest are added to a `flexibleTaskList`. The `Task`s in the `flexibleTaskList` are sorted based on their `importance` and `deadline`. Finally, the `TimeAllocator` iterates through the `fixedTaskList` to find empty time slots in a day, which is then allocated to the `Task`s in the sorted `flexibleTaskList`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the allocate operation works:

*Work in progress*

**Step 4.** The user executes `list` to get an overview of the week. The user sees all 5 tasks in the printed timetable.

### Data storage
The storage mechanism is facilitated by `Storage`. It reads and writes the `Task`s in a `TaskList` to `data.csv`, a csv file located next to the application jar file.
It implements the following operations:

* `Storage#saveTaskListData` - Writes the current tasks into the save file.
* `Storage#loadTaskListData` - Loads the tasks in the save file into the application.

These operations are called by the `LogicManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the storage mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `TaskList` is initialized to be empty. At this time, there is no *data.csv* file present. So, when `Storage` calls `Storage#loadTaskListData`, this is detected and an empty *data.csv* file is created next to the jar file. Since there was no save file, the `TaskList` remains empty.

**Step 2.** The user adds a task to the application, by executing `add n/Assignment1 t/1100 D/16-09-2020 d/2 r/Today i/high a/Refer to lecture notes`. The `TaskList` now contains 1 task (Assignment 1). After the command is executed, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveTaskListData` to automatically save the tasks in the `TaskList` into the save file.

**Step 3.** The user closes the application. Nothing happens since the data in the `TaskList` is already saved.

**Step 4.** The user launches the application again. The `TaskList` is initialized to be empty. `Storage#loadTaskListData` will read from `data.csv` and add the tasks inside the file into the empty `TaskList`. The `TaskList` now contains the task added earlier (Assignment 1) in **step 3**.

**Step 5.** The user executes `list` to get an overview of the week. The user sees *Assignment 1* in the printed timetable.

## Appendix: Requirements

## Product scope
### Target user profile
* is a university student
* has a need to manage a significant number of tasks
* can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is comfortable using the command line interface

#### Value proposition
* ATHENA helps students to automate the process of organising their schedule. After the user inputs pre-allocated time slots for work and relaxation, ATHENA figures out the best theoretical timetable based on the userâ€™s needs.
* It can be updated anytime during the week.
* ATHENA helps to reduce the amount of time and effort that users need to spend planning their time by finding free spaces to slot tasks in, with the goal of reducing dead space in the userâ€™s timetable. 
* The planner will also make sure the user has enough time to eat, exercise and sleep. The user can set up ATHENA to follow a fixed weekly routine, and only needs to update a task list. ATHENA will then plan the timetable based on the importance and deadlines of the tasks in the list, making sure that the user is able to finish everything on time.
