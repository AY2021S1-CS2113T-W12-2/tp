## Design & implementation

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the ATHENA. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has one class called [`Athena`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Athena.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of these components.

* [**`Ui`**](#ui-component): The UI of ATHENA.
* [**`Parser`**](#parser-component): Parses user input and command executor.
* [**`TaskList`**](#tasklist-component): The list that stores the user's tasks.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

### UI component

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Ui.java)

### Parser component

**API** :
[`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Parser.java)

### TaskList component

**API** :
[`TaskList.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/TaskList.java)

### Storage component

**API** : 
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athena/Storage.java)

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Product scope
### Target user profile
* is a university student
* has a need to manage a significant number of tasks
* can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is comfortable using the command line interface

### Value proposition
* Our product will aim to help students organize their schedule faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app. 
* It will reduce the amount of time and effort that users need to spend planning their time needed, by finding free spaces to slot tasks in reducing the dead space in the timetable. 
* The planner will also make sure the user has enough time to eat, exercise and sleep. Since there will be tasks added to the planner at any point in time, the todo list will be self-sorting as well. 
* It is meant to be used together with a relatively static long term weekly routine that can be set on the product, with the self optimising homework task list to react to changes throughout the year.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` installed.
2.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to use the features of ATHENA faster using commands than using the mouse.

## Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

## Instructions for manual testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the command line interface with welcome message.
