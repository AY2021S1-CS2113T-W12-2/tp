## Features 
Notes about the command format:
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, NAME is a parameter which the user provides, such as: `add n/Assignment1`.
* Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TIME`, `t/TIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Any unknown parameter type entered by the user that does not fit the parameters accepted in a respective feature will be ignored.
e.g `add n/NAME p/PARAMETER`, since `p/` is an unknown parameter type for `add` command, `p/PARAMETER` is ignored.
* If user types in 2 or more parameter description for each parameter type, only the first description will be taken.
e.g. if user types `n/NAME1 n/NAME2`, only `NAME1` will be recorded as the task's name.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g in `n/NAME  [d/DURATION]`, the parameters can be provided as `n/Task1 d/1` or as `n/Task1`.
(Refer to the Intermediate Usage section of each command for more information)
* For some commands, if no parameters are specified, the command will execute using the default values for each parameter.
* For dates, the program follows the **DD-MM-YYYY** format.
* For time, the program follows the **HHMM** format.
