## Features 
Notes about the command format:
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, NAME is a parameter which can be used as: `add n/Assignment1`.
* Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TIME`, `t/TIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `n/NAME  [d/DURATION]` can be used as `n/Task1 d/1` or as `n/Task1`.
* For some commands, if no parameters are specified, the command will execute using the default values for each parameter.
* For dates, the program follows the **DD-MM-YYYY** format.
* For time, the program follows the **HHMM** format.

The guide for this command is split into three sections:

* [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) (For users new to command line applications)
* [Intermediate Usage](#intermediate-usage) (For users comfortable with command line applications)
* [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) (Extension to *Intermediate Usage*)

#### Basic Usage

The `list` command accepts 2 parameters.
You can tell the command to filter your tasks based on

* the range of days you want to see
* the importance of the tasks

##### Command Format

* `FORECAST`: **DAY** to show the tasks today, **WEEK** to show the tasks one week from now, **ALL** to show the tasks within one month from now.

* `IMPORTANCE`: One of **HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, **LOW**, **ALL**.

##### Example Usage

The following shows the output from ATHENA after entering `list f/Week i/High`.
You should expect to see all **high importance tasks** occuring **within one week from now**.

*TODO: Insert screenshot*

#### Intermediate Usage

The `list` command accepts 2 parameters.
You can tell the command to filter your tasks based on

* the range of days you want to see
* the importance of the tasks

These parameters are optional. If they are left empty, ATHENA will use the default value assigned.

##### Command Format

`list [f/FORECAST] [i/IMPORTANCE]`

* `FORECAST`: **DAY** to show the tasks today, **WEEK** to show the tasks within one week from now, **ALL** to show the tasks within one month from now.
