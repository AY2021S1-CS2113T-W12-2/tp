## Features 
Notes about the command format:
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, NAME is a parameter which can be used as: `add n/Assignment1`.
* Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TIME`, `t/TIME n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g `n/NAME  [d/DURATION]` can be used as `n/Task1 d/1` or as `n/Task1`.
* For some commands, if no parameters are specified, the command will execute using the default values for each parameter.
* For dates, the program follows the DD-MM-YYYY format.
* For time, the program follows the HHMM format.
