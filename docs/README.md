# ATHENA (Automated Timetable Helper Encourager n' Assistant)

Our product aims to help students organize their schedule based on the amount of free time and work they have. It is updated minimally on a weekly basis.

It helps to reduce the amount of time and effort that users need to spend planning their time by finding free spaces to slot tasks in, with the goal of reducing dead space in the userâ€™s timetable. 

The planner will also make sure the user has enough time to eat, exercise and sleep. Since tasks are allowed to be added to the planner at any point in time, the todo list will also be self-sorting. It is meant to be used with a relatively static long term weekly routine that can be set on the application, with the self optimising homework task list reacting to changes throughout the year.
